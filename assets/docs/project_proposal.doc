## **1. Problem Statement (with Background)**

In many cities, finding rental homes and apartments is still a frustrating process. People often depend on social media posts or local advertisements that are unverified or outdated. This makes it difficult for tenants to find suitable housing and for landlords to reach interested renters easily.

The main issue is the lack of a simple and centralized web platform for listing, searching, and renting homes. A dedicated system would make this process more organized, reliable, and transparent.

This project aims to solve the problem by developing a straightforward home renting web application that directly connects landlords and tenants.

## **2. Project Goal and Objectives**

### **Goal**

To design and develop a responsive web application that allows landlords and tenants to list, search, rent, and sell residential homes and apartments.

### **Objectives**

1. To develop a working web application using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. To allow landlords to register and post property listings with descriptions and images.
3. To allow tenants to browse, search, and send booking inquiries.
4. To provide a basic admin panel for managing listings and users.
5. To ensure the system is responsive and easy to use across different devices.

## **4. Significance of the Project and SDLC Model**

### **Significance**

This project provides hands-on experience in full-stack web development and demonstrates the application of software engineering principles in real-life systems.

RentSmart serves as a practical learning project that strengthens understanding of requirement analysis, system design, database management, and teamwork in software development.

### **SDLC Model: Rapid Application Development (RAD)**

The Rapid Application Development (RAD) model is selected because it supports fast prototyping, frequent user feedback, and quick iteration. This makes it suitable for student projects with limited time and resources.
